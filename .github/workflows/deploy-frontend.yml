name: Deploy Frontend to Azure Static Web Apps

# ACTIVE: Supplementary frontend deploy with concurrency to avoid conflicts.
# deploy.yml remains the primary deploy; this workflow is serialized via
# frontend-deployment group and can still be run manually if needed.
#
# NOTE: PR deployments create staging environments on Azure Static Web Apps.
# Free tier limit: 3 staging environments. If limit is reached, deployment fails.
# Solution: Run the "Cleanup Staging Environments" workflow to delete old environments.
# See: docs/QUICK_FIX_STAGING_LIMIT.md for more information.

            const message = `### ⚠️ Staging Environment Deployment Failed
            
            The deployment to Azure Static Web Apps failed. This is likely because the staging environment limit has been reached.
            
            **Quick Fix**:
            1. Go to [Actions](https://github.com/${context.repo.owner}/${context.repo.repo}/actions/workflows/cleanup-staging-environments.yml)
            2. Click "Run workflow"
            3. Delete old staging environments
            4. Re-run this workflow
            
            **Or manually**: Delete old environments in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) → Static Web Apps → Environments
