The Employee Master Record is the spine of the entire system.
Every other module links to this. Nothing links sideways.
Non-negotiable anchor field:
•	Employee Number (unique, immutable)
This is the only field that:
•	never changes
•	never gets reused
•	never gets edited
Everything else can evolve.

2. MIGRATION STRATEGY (DO NOT DUMP EVERYTHING AT ONCE)
Rule
Migrate in layers, not in bulk
Why:
•	avoids corrupt links
•	avoids compliance gaps
•	avoids rework
________________________________________
3. LAYER 1 — CORE EMPLOYEE MASTER (MIGRATE FIRST)
This is what you migrate from your existing list immediately.
Employee Master – Core Fields
These must exist before anything else.
Category	Field
Identity	Employee Number
Identity	Full Name
Org	Job Title
Org	Department
Org	Line Manager
Employment	Employment Status
Employment	Date of Joining
Employment	Work Location
System	Employee Type (Employee / Manager)
Why this layer first
•	Enables linking
•	Enables permissions
•	Enables dashboards
•	Enables compliance mapping
❗ At this stage:
•	No documents
•	No bank details
•	No salary
•	No personal data
________________________________________
4. LAYER 2 — PERSONAL DETAILS (SEPARATE, LINKED)
Personal data must NOT live directly inside Employee Master.
Personal Details Table (Linked to Employee Master)
Link field:
•	Employee Number → Employee Master
Fields to migrate / collect here
Basic Personal
•	Date of Birth
•	Gender
•	Nationality
•	Personal Email
•	Personal Mobile
Emergency
•	Emergency Contact Name
•	Relationship
•	Contact Number
Family (if applicable)
•	Marital Status
•	Dependents (basic identifiers only)
❗Important:
•	This layer can be partially empty
•	Missing data is acceptable temporarily
•	Completion % will be tracked later
________________________________________
5. LAYER 3 — COMPLIANCE & LEGAL DATA (HR-ONLY)
This layer is critical for UAE risk control and must be isolated.
Compliance Table (Linked to Employee Master)
Link field:
•	Employee Number → Employee Master
Mandatory UAE Fields
Category	Field
Visa	Visa Number
Visa	Visa Issue Date
Visa	Visa Expiry Date
EID	Emirates ID Number
EID	Emirates ID Expiry
Medical	Medical Fitness Date
Medical	Medical Fitness Expiry
Insurance	ILOE Status
Insurance	ILOE Expiry
Contract	Contract Type
Contract	Contract Start
Contract	Contract End
Why separate
•	HR-only access
•	Audit readiness
•	Clean expiry logic
•	No accidental exposure
________________________________________
6. LAYER 4 — BANK & PAYROLL REFERENCE (RESTRICTED)
This is visibility + validation, not payroll processing.
Bank Details Table (Linked)
Link field:
•	Employee Number → Employee Master
Fields
•	Bank Name
•	IBAN
•	Account Holder Name
•	Effective Date
❗Key rule:
•	Employees can submit
•	HR validates
•	No direct overwrite
________________________________________
7. LAYER 5 — DOCUMENTS (DO NOT MIGRATE BLINDLY)
Documents should not be dumped.
Document Registry (Linked)
Link field:
•	Employee Number → Employee Master
Document Metadata (before files)
•	Document Type
•	Issue Date
•	Expiry Date
•	Status (Valid / Expiring / Expired)
Only after metadata exists → documents are attached.
This prevents:
•	lost documents
•	expired docs hiding in folders
•	audit nightmares

8. HOW LINKING WORKS (SIMPLE RULESET)
Golden Rules
1.	Employee Master never links outward
2.	All other tables link into Employee Master
3.	No circular links
4.	No duplicate identity fields across tables
Standard Linking Pattern
Employee Master
   ↑
   ├── Personal Details
   ├── Compliance
   ├── Bank Details
   ├── Attendance
   ├── Leave
   ├── Requests
   ├── Documents
________________________________________
9. MIGRATION ORDER (DO THIS EXACTLY IN THIS SEQUENCE)
1.	Import Employee Master (core only)
2.	Validate Employee Numbers (duplicates = STOP)
3.	Link Line Managers
4.	Attach Personal Details
5.	Attach Compliance Data
6.	Attach Bank Details
7.	Create empty shells for:
o	Attendance
o	Leave
o	Requests
8.	Only then → documents
________________________________________
10. COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID (VERY IMPORTANT)
Do not:
•	use names as identifiers
•	merge personal + compliance + employment in one table
•	import documents without metadata
•	allow employees to edit master fields
•	migrate everything “because we already have it”
Migration is controlled exposure, not copying.
