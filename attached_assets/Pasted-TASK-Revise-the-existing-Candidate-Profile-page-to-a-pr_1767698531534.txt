TASK:
Revise the existing Candidate Profile page to a production-ready structure suitable for a UAE-based HR Portal.

CONTEXT:
This is a candidate-centric profile (not role-centric). The profile is created from CV/LinkedIn and later accessible by the candidate via a “Candidate Pass” to update missing details. HR retains control over internal fields.

DO NOT redesign from scratch. Modify the existing UI and data structure.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. HEADER (KEEP, MINIMAL CHANGES)
- Candidate Name
- Primary Role / Title
- Recruitment Pass ID
- Candidate ID
- Status badge (Applied, Screening, Interview, etc.)
- ADD: Source badge (LinkedIn / Referral / Agency)

2. POSITION APPLIED FOR (KEEP, EXTEND)
Fields:
- Position Title
- Department
- Employment Type
- Salary Range
- ADD: Hiring Manager (HR-only)
- ADD: Job Requisition ID (HR-only, hidden from candidate)

3. CONTACT INFORMATION (KEEP, EXTEND)
Fields:
- Email
- Phone
- LinkedIn (clickable)
- ADD: Preferred Contact Method (Email / WhatsApp / Call)
- ADD: Timezone

4. EXPERIENCE & EMPLOYMENT (RESTRUCTURE)
Split into TWO sections:

A. PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
- Current Position
- Current Company
- Total Years of Experience
- Industry / Function

B. AVAILABILITY & COMPENSATION
- Notice Period (mandatory after Screening)
- Availability Date (auto-calculated from notice period)
- Expected Salary
- Current Salary (optional)
- Currency
- Negotiable (Yes / No)

5. LOCATION & WORK ELIGIBILITY (EXTEND)
Fields:
- Current Country
- Emirate (Dubai / Abu Dhabi / etc.)
- Visa Status (Visit / Employment / Golden / Dependent / Outside UAE)
- Visa Expiry Date
- Willingness to Relocate (Yes / No)
- Driving License

6. DOCUMENTS SECTION (ADD)
Create a dedicated section (even if empty):
- CV / Resume
- Portfolio (optional)
- Certificates
- Passport Copy (late stage only)
- Visa Copy (late stage only)

7. SKILLS & NOTES (SPLIT – IMPORTANT)
Replace the single “Notes” block with:

A. SKILLS SNAPSHOT (structured, tag-based)
- Core Skills
- Programming Languages
- Hardware / Platforms
- Protocols / Tools

B. RECRUITER NOTES (HR-only)
- Free text
- Interview observations
- Risk flags

8. CANDIDATE CONFIRMATION & AUDIT (ADD)
Display:
- “Details confirmed by candidate” (checkbox + timestamp)
- Last updated by (Candidate / HR)
- Last updated date & time

9. ACCESS CONTROL LOGIC (IMPLEMENT)
Candidate CAN edit:
- Contact details
- Location & visa fields
- Notice period
- Expected salary
- Upload documents

Candidate CANNOT edit:
- Applied role
- Status
- Recruiter notes
- Evaluations
- Hiring decisions

10. UX RULES
- Replace “Not specified” with “Pending candidate input”
- Use 2-column layouts where possible
- Keep UI clean and enterprise-grade
- Add HR-only button: “Request Update from Candidate”

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- Updated component structure
- Updated field grouping
- Clear separation of candidate-editable vs HR-only fields
- No placeholder text, no mock data explanations

Proceed directly with implementation changes.
